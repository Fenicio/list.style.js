# list.style.js
Custom styler for List.js

This is my first attempt at creating a plugin for list.js, also the first time using bower and grunt outside a tutorial, so i don't know what i'm doing.

But it somehow works.

Proper use can be seen in the example folder.

(//TODO proper tests, examples, documentation)
